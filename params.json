Fork it!\r\n2. Create your feature branch (```git checkout -b my-new-feature```).\r\n3. Commit your changes (```git commit -am 'Added some feature'```)\r\n4. Push to the branch (```git push origin my-new-feature```)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n...or follow steps described in a nice [fork guide](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) by Karl Broman\r\n",
